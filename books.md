I've been trying to force myself to become a reader for a couple years now, but I hadn't actually finished a book until 2021. This is my year. 

## 2022

Last year I read 8 books, all non-fiction. This year my goal is to read 9, with some fiction in there.

### Harry Potter 1

I liked this book. It wasn't my favorite of the series, but it got me into the series, so I have to give it some creds for that. I feel like not much really happened in the book, besides introducing the world of wizardry. Snape was a crazy red-herring. I've even seen the movie so I know that he wasn't the bad guy, and I still thought it was him while reading.

### Harry Potter 2

This felt like a big step up from book 1. I couldn't remember what happened in the movie, so the mystery of the basilisk was still exciting to me. This was my 3rd favorite book in the series.

### Harry Potter 3

This may have been my least favorite HP. I dunno, the Sirius Black storyline wasn't as compelling to me. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it. All the books were bangers, but the ending was so frustrating in this one that I didn't like it as much

### Harry Potter 4
