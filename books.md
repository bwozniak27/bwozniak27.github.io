I've been trying to force myself to become a reader for a couple years now, but I hadn't actually finished a book until 2021. This is my year. 

## 2022

Last year I read 8 books, all non-fiction. This year my goal is to read 9, with some fiction in there.

### The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry

This was a re-read for me, but still hit. The art of slowing down life and living more intentially is a lesson I think everyone can use.

### Harry Potter 1

I liked this book. It wasn't my favorite of the series, but it got me into the series, so I have to give it some creds for that. I feel like not much really happened in the book, besides introducing the world of wizardry. Snape was a crazy red-herring. I've even seen the movie so I know that he wasn't the bad guy, and I still thought it was him while reading.

### Harry Potter 2

This felt like a big step up from book 1. I couldn't remember what happened in the movie, so the mystery of the basilisk was still exciting to me. This was my 3rd favorite book in the series.

### Harry Potter 3

This may have been my least favorite HP. I dunno, the Sirius Black storyline wasn't as compelling to me. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it. All the books were bangers, but the ending was so frustrating in this one that I didn't like it as much

### Harry Potter 4

This was mid level for me. Wasn't the best one, wasn't the worst one. The ending was sick with Voldemort coming back. I had seen the movie so I knew that Mad-eye wasn't really Mad-eye and was the bad guy, but somehow I still didn't see it coming when the big reveal came. Crazy man.

### Harry Potter 5

I hated Umbridge in the movie, but she was 10x worse in the book because it was so dang long. It did make the ending so very satisfying though.

### Harry Potter 6

This might have been my favorite one. The Horocruxes were sick and honestly I liked the romance stuff. I just hate that they had to say "snogging" so much. That's like the worst word for kissing ever. Dang brits. I knew the ending was coming, but it was still real sad when Dumbledore died.

### Harry Potter 7

This one was soo good. You really felt the darkness over the world with Voldemort and the desperation of the situation was felt. Then when everyone was dying it was very sad. So much happened in this book. I was also glad that they actually explained the ending unlike the movie. I felt post-book depression after this one for a bit, though.

### In a Dark, Dark Wood

This is the first book I've ever read in one day. It was my first thriller and I couldn't put it down. I did predict the ending, but it was exciting to, not disappointing.

### To All The Boys I've Loved Before

I wanted to try a rom-com, so I grabbed this one. I didn't think I'd like it but I actually did. It felt nostalgic of high school dating and stayed pretty light and I liked it.

### PS I Still Love You

Book 2 in the series. I thought I was sold on Peter, until I met John. I'm team John still, he's a way better fit for her than Peter in my opinion.

### Always and Forever

This one wasn't as good, but I had to keep reading. Idk if I like the ending or not. I was hoping it was gonna end with her going to school with John and falling for him, but it didn't. I guess it's nice that her and Peter stayed together, but also, there's like no way they stay together in college. That stuff's a fairytale. P.S: don't watch the movies, they were cheesy as heck.

### Crazy Rich Asians

I wanted to try a more grown up rom-com, and since I liked this movie, I thought I'd try. It was actually pretty different from the movie. The ending's aren't the same at all, and it wasn't that rom-comy actually. The rich life is fun to read about.

### China Rich Girlfriend

I liked that this one had a big emphasis on Astrid. I think she's more interesting than Rachel. It did kinda seem like they were just trying to top the exorbitance of the first book, though, which felt a bit excessive. 

### Rich People Problems

I liked that this one got back to the Youngs. It was crazy in the end to find out Su-Yi didn't actually have any money, so the real rich one was her brother Alfred. Now I'm just left to speculate about how rich he is. I liked this series a lot actually.

### Educated

This was the first memoir I've read, and it was really good. What a crazy life she lived. The abuse parts were hard to read, but when she went to school it was inspiring to read about her learning.

### The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe

This book was definitely aimed at kindergardeners, but that made it a very quick and easy read. The way Lewis describes Aslan is such a cool description of Christ.
